# Using images of breast masses to predict the prognosis of breast cancer (into two classes: non-recurrent (N) and recurrent (R)) and evaluating the model

Data downloaded from the UCI machine learning data repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wpbc.data

(The characteristics of the images have been recorded and turned into strucured numerical data)

A random forest model was built to predict the prognosis.

The accuracy of the model was assessed.

An ROC curve was built.
